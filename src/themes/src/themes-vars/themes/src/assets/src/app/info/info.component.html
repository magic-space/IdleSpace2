        <p>
          Research is generated by scientists. Researches in the "In Progress"
          column are researched, those in the "Backlog" are not.
          <br />
          Some researches, like "Origin" are exclusive, you can get only one per
          run.
          <br />
          Some researches can be "boosted" by doing task like "build one mine"
          or "build one mine". Boost increase research progress by
          {{ INSPIRATION_PERCENT | percent }}, research must be unlocked and can
          be boosted only one time per level. See the rising arrow in the

        <h2>Warfare</h2>
        <p>
          In order to acquire new district you will need to win battles. On the
          Fleet section you can change your fleet composition. On the Design tab
          you can create new Ships design or change existing designs. Enemies
          can be searched on the Enemies section.
        </p>
        <h3>Fleets</h3>
        <p>
          You can have up to five fleets with different composition, one fleet
          can have up to
          {{ FLEET_CAPACITY | format }} naval capacity. There aren't penalties
          for using more fleets. Ships naval capacity are equal to the maximum
          number of module levels.
        </p>
        <h3>Battle</h3>
        <p>
          Battle time is determined by enemy distance of your slowest ship.
          <br />
          Battle results can be analysed on the "Reports" section. Battle
          consist on five rounds, on each round:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ships fire in orderly fashion, having anti-shield before anti-armour
            ship is recommended.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each weapon fire to one semi random target, including ships dead in
            this round. "Threat" is the chance to be chosen, some modules
            increase the threat of some ships. "Accuracy" increase threat of
            alive ships, "Adaptive Precision" increase threat proportional to
            weapon armour %, shield % and defence %.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attacher gain threat based on damage done, "Threat multi" can
            increase or decrease that amount. Threat is added at the end of the
            round.
          </li>
          <li>
            In case target has no shield and armour is lower than explosion
            threshold there is a chance to explode. Chance is proportional to
            missing armour and occur on each shot, if conditions are met. In
            case exploded ship has "Explosion damage", damage is dealt to
            attackers. Explosion damage is 100% armour and 100% shield.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the end of each round dead ships are removed and will not be
            target in the next round. Ships gain threat based on damage done or
            "Threat per round".
          </li>
          <li>
            Shield are regenerated, if some ships have "Shield Recharge".
            "Shield Recharge" apply to any ships with shield greater than zero,
            ships with lower shield percent have priority. If a ships has shield
            completely depleted shield will not be regenerated.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ground Defences</h3>
        <p>
          Enemies may have ground defences, planetary defences works exactly
          like ships but can be completely destroyed by Nuke. Ground defences
          don't require energy because are attached to the planet energy grid.
          <br />
          After level 50 enemies will have anti missiles, one anti missiles
          completely block one nuke.

        <h2>Designs</h2>
        <p>
          On the "Design" section you can create or update ship designs. Each
          ship can equip a maximum number of modules and module points. larger
          modules cost more points and have a small bonus compared to more small
          modules.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Armour</strong>
            is the ship health. Ships have some base armour.

          <li>
            <strong>Armour%</strong>
            increase armour by a percent.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shield</strong>
            is depleted before Armour. It prevents ship explosion, that is based
            on armour, so is more valuable but require energy. Shield can be
            recharged. <strong>Shield%</strong> and
            <strong>Shield Damage Reduction</strong> work in the same way of
            armour.

          Some features of the game can be automated. On
          <i nz-icon nzType="sync"></i> "Automation" section automation can be
          enabled or disabled. This include drones auto buy automations. Doesn't
          include drones assembly with components, auto fight, auto nuke, and
          auto reinforce.
        </p>
        <h3>Drones</h3>
        <p>
          Drone auto buy can be configured on each drone card. There are two
          automations for drones: auto buy with resources and assembly with
          components. Those options are completely unrelated.
        </p>
        <h3>Drones - Comp. priorities</h3>
        <p>
          This is the options for components. There are two priorities, the
          first is used by default, the second is used when the product of that
          drone are ending. The second should be way higher n order to prevent
          blackout. Below you can see how many components are reserved for that
          drone.
        </p>
        <h3>Drones - Auto Buy</h3>
        <p>
          This automation buy drones with resources, you can set max buy and
          interval.
          <br />
          "Total buy" is the maximum quantity you want to be bought when you
          have at least one replicator. The price increase exponentially, so at
          some point buying drones are not worth it.
          <br />
          On each update cycle automations are executed from higher priority to
          low. Usually you can ignore this.
          <br />
          <strong>Auto Buy doesn't work in this cases:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Production of any resources consumed by this drone are less than
              1/s:</strong
            >
            this prevent some blackout.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Drone is not 100% operative:</strong>
            There is no reason to buy, increase operativity instead.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Manual buy is greater than "Total buy" and there are
              replicators:</strong
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Drones - Auto Modding</h3>
        <p>
          On the modding screen, whe auto mod is active, you can set up auto
          modding. Auto modding doesn't consider existing mods, allocated mods
          will be overwritten. Mods are rounded floor, a few mods may be not
          allocated.
          <br />
          Negative priorities are calculated in proportion to total positive
          priorities, if you want any mod to be as low as possible, regardless
          of positive mods, put -10000.
          <br />
          By default auto mod execute each time the new configuration differ
          from the actual configuration, in practice every time you gains new
          mods. To prevent unwanted modding increase "Min. components %" or the
          automation interval.

        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p>
          Components are used to make drones, see "Automation" info. Components
          storage is used only when all drones are at maximum quantity, before
          that components are reserved. On drone's pages you can see how many
          components are reserved and how many are needed to make one drone.
        </p>
        <h2>Components and Drone modding</h2>
        <p>
          When your technology are high enough, you will be able to improve your
          drones. When modding, all drones except for one will be destroyed. The
          maximum amount of mods depends on drone type and ca be increased with
          drone's technology (es. Mining for miners), robotics technology and
          researches. Hover "Total:" on mod page to see details.
        </p>
        <h3>Recycling</h3>
        <p>
          Recycling increase component recovery from drones, recycling can be
          increased from mod or researches. Whenever you mod a drone you will
          get back an amount of components equal to "actual recycling" * "drone
          quantity". Those components are used immediately to rebuild this
          specific drones and are not affected by components storage.
